    "### 1042. Flower Planting With No Adjacent\n",
    "Medium\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint\n",
    "You have n gardens, labeled from 1 to n, and an array paths where paths[i] = [xi, yi] describes a bidirectional path between garden xi to garden yi. In each garden, you want to plant one of 4 types of flowers.\n",
    "\n",
    "All gardens have at most 3 paths coming into or leaving it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to choose a flower type for each garden such that, for any two gardens connected by a path, they have different types of flowers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return any such a choice as an array answer, where answer[i] is the type of flower planted in the (i+1)th garden. The flower types are denoted 1, 2, 3, or 4. It is guaranteed an answer exists.\n",

    "Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: n = 3, paths = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,1]]\n",
    "Output: [1,2,3]\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "Gardens 1 and 2 have different types.\n",
    "Gardens 2 and 3 have different types.\n",
    "Gardens 3 and 1 have different types.\n",
    "Hence, [1,2,3] is a valid answer. Other valid answers include [1,2,4], [1,4,2], and [3,2,1].\n",
    "Example 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: n = 4, paths = [[1,2],[3,4]]\n",
    "Output: [1,2,1,2]\n",
    "Example 3:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: n = 4, paths = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,1],[1,3],[2,4]]\n",
